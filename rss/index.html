In the recent US elections, Trump lost in all of America&apos;s largest cities but was carried into White House on the shoulders of rest of the country. Earlier to that Brexit leave campaign won despite losing in almost all big cities. In hopes of populist theories, political opposers of Chandrababu Naidu were spitting against Amaravati with spineless logic and trying to instigate sub-regional divide among people and same section of feckless cults talk about what&apos;s not happening in Amaravati.</p><p>Few landlords in the locality were trapped in their ideology and started agitating against land pooling by refusing to give their land under LPS scheme. Such lands amounted to ~2000 acres. Winners don&#x2019;t make excuses when the other side plays the game. Probably, Able persons should have stepped in and buy off those lands in favor of LPS and avoid land acquisition.</p><p>In other words politicians, journalists, columnists, pundits, leaders of all kinds&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;failed catastrophically, historically, spectacularly for not pointing out the herd as dangerous social behaviour and also for not seeing the obstacles caused by those 2% non-pooled lands. Those handful of landlords can&apos;t dictate the fate of a futuristic city where millions of people would live in, indeed they should be looked down for what they did by delaying the Amaravati dream.</p><p>India had build only a handful of cities in the last 100 years and one thing we all would agree is Indian urban scape is in chaos, unimaginably dangerous with unplanned mobility. We can&apos;t live forever in chaos while the other side of world is building&#xA0;<a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/reimagining-cities-from-the-internet-up-5923d6be63ba?ref=localhost">Internet up cities</a>&#xA0;from the scratch.

What the world need to know from Brexit?"><p>The Brexit has shown that masses are stupid when it comes to making policy decisions. While Donald Trump&apos;s campaign succeeded on cashing out the mortal imbecility on trusting narcissistic patriotism by securing nomination for the Presidential Race. Masses are prone to emotions and a crowd is always more irrational than an individual.</p><p>What i fear most is, Mass emotions plays the similar role else where in the world polity. In India, it is almost easy for any Tom, Dick, Harry to fire agitations based on caste, state-hood or religion. The likes of Mr. ChandraSekhar, Jagan, Hardik, Mudragada knew the simplicity of starting &amp; leading one, if you have a trouble at believing. It all happens under the mask of public interest, perhaps even public don&apos;t know that before taking a side.</p><p>As Viswanathan rightly quoted,&#xA0;<strong>People often confuse a democracy with an Ochlocracy</strong>. Democracy doesn&#x2019;t mean people having the right to decide in all policy decisions. Not always! not necessarily. If you ask people to chose between spending your excess 10,000 Crores on welfare vs education reforms, you know what people would chose obviously. (Do we really want most liked or retweeted post to be discussed at House of members? )</p><p>Discussion &amp; debates on people&apos;s voice is always advisory whereas decisions on sole verdict is often proved extremely dangerous.<br>The strength of a democracy is not from its voting processes, but in its ability to bring diverse interests to discuss about a society&#x2019;s future. That is the strength of a democratic system - the ability to hear diverse voices and not the ability of masses to select the best.</p><p>Democracy definitions are to be re-written in most of our dictionaries to protect the masses from themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to build TensorFlow, a fast & flexible Deep learning platform with GPU Support on Ubuntu?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>With the increasing velocity of data from all the directions, providing data scientists with the best tool is tough.

He encouraged a millions of anonymous Indians to come out on the streets and get voice. I closely watched few students in my university thinking about the on-going fast and corruption than themselves much.</p><p>Anna exposed a political class, suffering from a grave moral crisis, to the wider world. He empowered those who&#x2019;ve felt lost in a new India where wealth is the sole presiding deity. Anna become a symbol of change and hope at a time when a scam culture has assaulted the conscience of the nation.</p><p>Survivor of Gandhian ideology?</p><p>Gandhi, the great Indian, from whom Anna claim to derive inspiration, never went on a fast unto death by refusing medication. For Gandhi, the idea of fasting was a form of self purification, a fast could not be undertaken as he said, &#x201C;out of anger. Anger is a short-term madness.&#x201D; Yes, there is anger in the streets today, an almost volcanic eruption of a lava that has been simmering for decades.</p><p>There have been some signs of unwanted situations in the last two months that are truly worrying. The gherao of the homes of members of Parliament may be visually appealing, but it encourages an anti-politician &#x2018;sab neta chor hai&#x2019; rhetoric that could further destroy faith in parliamentary democracy.</p><p>How many Indians believe they&#xA0;<strong>also</strong>&#xA0;elected few good parliamentarians?</p><p>After the British colonial rule, We chose parliamentary democracy to rule our country, our people. Accordingly, People elect representatives, they are responsible to make the laws but not an individual or a civil-groups. By any luck/unluck if this uncredited govt steps down to Jan-Lokpal bill , I&#x2019;m sure that will be credited as the result of Hazare&#x2019;s Fasting!</p><p>Where will this take us? How many fast-unto deaths we have to see? Most of, will start a fast-unto death to fulfill their demands! (Giving away separate states, if hundred people sits down for fast-unto death??)

Dwarf is the person, one who develops future Intellectual pursuits by understanding the Research&apos;s and works created by notable thinkers of the past.</p><p>I would call the Scientists, Writers, Analysts, Medico&apos;s, Observers in the past as Giants and we evolved to this stage from their Observations and Experiences.</p><blockquote>Bernard of Chartres used to say that we are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they,and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.</blockquote><p>Earlier mankind doesn&apos;t have knowledge on burning capability of fire, once he experience it, he knew it. So I didn&apos;t think long to say, Knowledge derives from &quot;Experience&quot;. You won&apos;t become Astronomer, if you sit down and cry &quot;Astronomy, Astronomy&quot; , rather taking telescope and experimenting on the sky and stars can make you the &apos;Astronomer&apos;. For that, you may need to refer what are previous Astronomer&apos;s observations and learnings!</p><p>Same way, to accomplish a task or your desire, provide yourself with known-facts, techniques &amp; Arrange your ideas, do-able things perfectly and rapidly start your work. Remember, Avoid &quot;Re-Inventing Wheel&quot;.</p><p>As a whole, I can say that, Knowledge is not a proprietary thing and it is a common heritage of all Mankind.</p><p>Still, If you believe Knowledge is a God-sent trait found only in Privileged, Think Again!!&#xA0;<strong>Again n Again</strong>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is FOSS and its four principles?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is Satish, a brand new site by Satish V Madala that&apos;s just getting started.

The &#x201C;free&#x201D; as is used in Free and Open Source Software&apos;s refers to &#x2018;free as in freedom&#x2019; rather cost. More precisely it refers to four kinds of freedom to the user&#x2019;s of the Software:</p><p>&#x2022; Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.</p><p>&#x2022; Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</p><p>&#x2022; Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour.</p><p>&#x2022;* Freedom 3*: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</p><p>The Idea being that once shared, the code will assist someone else&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;No need to Re-invent the Wheel.</p><p>I believe that, Knowledge is a Common Heritage of Mankind, and thus software, a form of knowledge, has to be free and accessible to all. And this encumbers :</p><blockquote>There must be &#x201C;Open Distribution&#x201D; and &#x201C;Open Modification&#x201D;</blockquote><p>ALL TIME BIGGEST SOFTWARE REVOLUTION</p><p>Coding is no longer the domain of just Software engineers. All branches of engineering use software tools, be it Computer Aided Design(CAD), Geographical Information Systems(GIS), Latex or Electronic Design Automation.</p><p>Wake up Engineers... you are different from Ordinary Mortals (Isn&#x2019;t it?) Start Using Open Source Tools and Contribute to the world of real knowledge with Open Minds.An Open Document is much like a Physics Experiment to which hundreds of Researchers Contribute.</p><p><strong>Internet Runs on FOSS:</strong></p><p>Do you Know ? Internet Products like Wikipedia, Facebook, Drupal, Wordpress, Apache, Gmail, Firefox, Chrome etc purely rely on FOSS. Internet Runs on FOSS</p><p>For that instance GOOGLE Inc is the largest FOSS Consumption Company. and It&#x2019;s Contribution to the Open Source is also Notable. More than 86% of Google Servers run on Linux based Servers. Google gives to Open Source Community through code.google.com and Google Summer of Code etc, If you look at Google, most of its products are free/ low cost.</p><p>There are many licenses are in use at FOSS Communities, among General Public License (GPL)(Most Linux Products like Ubuntu are GPL Compatible), BSD license(Google Uses most), CC-BY-SA License(Wikipedia Uses this), MIT license are Popular.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
